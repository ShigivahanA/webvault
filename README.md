WebVault solves some common problems in web development:

Secure storage: Encrypts data using AES to protect sensitive info.

Namespaced storage: Avoids collisions in localStorage or sessionStorage.

Expiry management: Allows you to set TTLs for temporary data (e.g., sessions, tokens).

Cross-environment compatible: Works in browsers and Node.js.

Lightweight & simple: No need to implement encryption, TTL, or namespace logic yourself.
